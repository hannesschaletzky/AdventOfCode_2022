### 2022, day 5:

1. think more table / matrix like when parsing input in such a format

### 2022, day 6:

1. use Set to identify unique values; [example](https://github.com/BraedenKilburn/AdventOfCode2022/blob/master/Day%206/solution.js)
2. having prototype extension functions is pretty cool!
3. don't always think one by one, but rather try to solve things in blocks (like chunks of messages, instead of each character one by one). Think about operations that facilitate. Instead of writing the loop so it starts from the back so the array is reversed, write a normal look and put .reverse() after it.
